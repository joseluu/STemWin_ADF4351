This code drives an ADF4351 RF synthetiser module using an STM32F747-DISCO.

The user interface is dialog based, uses STemWin as the GUI toolkit.

The code has been compiled using visual studio and visualGDB (gcc) and 
expects to find the STemWin software as a relative path: ..\STemWin_Library_V1.2.0  (otherwise as downloaded from st.com).
The library STemWin532_CM7_GCC.a should be renamed libSTemWin532_CM7_GCC.a
